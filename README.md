# the token for auth - is required and starts with perm:
api_token = perm:... 

filter_label = YouTrack Jetbrains (filter)
issues_label = YouTrack Jetbrains (issues)

issues_icon = youtrack
filter_icon = youtrack

[server/my-server2]

# enable = true
# youtrack base url
base_url = https://youtrack-server.foo.com

# the token for auth - is required and starts with perm:

```
## Features

### Filter mode
* Using the filter entry typing suggestions are made as provided by the YouTrack server.
* Use TAB to autocomplete which replaces your text with the suggested just like the query input field in the browser
* Using Enter opens the issue list with the filter criteria filled in

* Everything that is entered is used as a filter but unlike filter mode the completion is listing issues that match the search criteria
* Using Enter opens the selected issue from the suggestion list
